# pps-client.conf v2.0.0
# The configuration file for PPS-Client.

# Saves a distribution of the accumulated system clock time corrections made each
# second to /var/local/pps-error-distrib-forming which is transfered every 24 hours
# to /var/local/pps-error-distrib. Defaults to disabled.
#error-distrib=enable

# Saves a distribution of the accumulated jitter recorded each second to
# /var/local/pps-jitter-distrib-forming which is transfered every 24 hours   
# to /var/local/pps-jitter-distrib. Defaults to disabled.
#jitter-distrib=enable

# Allows PPS-Client to exit after the PPS interrupt is lost for one hour. If disabled, 
# PPS-Client holds the system clock frequency offset at the last update value but does 
# not automatically exit. Defaults to disabled.
#exit-lost-pps=enable

# If you want to use a source other than the NIST Internet time service to set the local 
# time of day, NIST can be specifically disabled to allow an external program to be used. 
# Defaults to enabled.
#nist=disable

# Local time of day can be set through a serial port connected to a GPS receiver or the 
# equivalent. If this option is enabled, the NIST option will be automatically disabled.
# Defaults to serial=disable.
#serial=enable

# This is the active serial port. If a different serial port is required set the device 
# name here in root format. Only used if serial=enable. 
serialPort=/dev/ttyS0

# This is the device name of the active PPS device. If different, set the device name 
# here in root format.
ppsdevice=/dev/pps0

# PPS delay correction in microseconds. This is the delay between the true time of the 
# asserted edge of the PPS signal and the time recorded for it in the Linux kernel. The 
# default value was determined for the different versions of the RPi and is automatically 
# used. The value is processor dependent. Consequently, if set here, that value will be 
# used instead of the default values.
#zeroOffset=0

# In most cases the PPS input is a normally low pulse that goes to a high logic level 
# for a small percentage of the time. However, if the PPS is introduced through a serial 
# port, the interface hardware might invert the phase so that the resulting RS232 pulse 
# is normally at a high logic level. In that case the clear (low-going) edge of the pulse 
# is the time reference edge. To use the clear edge, the following should be set to 
# ppsphase=1.
ppsphase=0

# Ubuntu and Debian. On other systems change as appropriate.

# In very noisy process environments or for testing it may be desirable to segregate 
# PPS-Client from other processes running on the processor (with a reduction of one core 
# for the other processes). This can be done by specifying which core PPS-Client should  
# run on and the number of cores (or threads on Intel/AMD processors) on the processor. 
# The default is no segregation and all cores are used for all process. Cores are numbered 
# from 0 to n-1 where n is the number of cores. For a small processor like Raspberry Pi, 
# to have PPS-Client run on core 0 of 4 cores this would be specified (uncommented) as,
#segregate=0/4

# Enable checking NTP server on first run
ntpcheck=enable

# Set the server to use for the first ntpdate update, which is fallback for when PPS has
# not been detected
