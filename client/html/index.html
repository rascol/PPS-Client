Uses</h1>
<p>Although the goal of high accuracy computer time keeping has been around since at least the introduction of the Network Time Protocol, general support for high precision time keeping over the Internet is probably not practical. However, GPS reception is available everywhere and in conjunction with a daemon like PPS-Client can be used for that purpose now. Indeed, an Internet search found commercial GPS repeaters that can bring GPS reception indoors with local coverage up to at least 30 meters.</p>
<p>The ability to time synchronize multiple computers with microsecond accuracy is particularly important for small embedded processors like the RPi that can be used to used to construct distributed systems with a large number of individual cores. This works very well when the individual RPis are time synchronized because that makes applications possible that would otherwise be difficult or impractical. One example is a high-speed multiple video camera system that synchronizes the video frames from the individual RPis each handling a different camera.</p>
<p>There are other uses for time synchronized computers: Network administrators might find it useful to have the possibility of making one-way, single-path time measurements of network delays. That becomes possible if the computers at the end points are accurately synchronized to GPS time - which is rarely the case at present. Then too, certain kinds of scientific applications require accurate synchronization to a GSP clock. One sometimes of interest to amateur astronomers is <a href="http://www.poyntsource.com/IOTAmanual/Preview.htm">occultation timing</a>. Another is collection of distributed seismic data with remote computers in the study of earthquakes or for substratum mapping. If computers were routinely provided with microsecond-accuracy time keeping other applications would soon appear.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="pps-client-high-accuracy-timekeeping"></a>
PPS-Client High Accuracy Timekeeping</h1>
<p>The PPS-Client daemon is implemented as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PID_controller">proportional-integral (PI) controller</a> (a.k.a. type 2 servo) with proportional and integral feedback provided each second but with the value of the integral feedback adjusted once per minute. The PI controller model provides a view of time synchronization as a linear feedback system in which gain coefficients can be adjusted to provide a good compromise among stability, transient response and amount of noise introduced in the error signal.</p>
<p>The error signal is the time difference between the one-second interval provided by a PPS signal and the length of the second reported by the system clock. The noise of concern is the second-to-second variation in time reported by the system because of the corresponding variation of system delay in responding to the PPS interrupt. This variable component of the delay, referred to as jitter, is a combination of clock oscillator jitter, PPS signal jitter and system latency in responding the the interrupt.</p>
<p>Because the error signal has jitter and is being used to control synchronization, the jitter component can have the effect of a <em>false error signal</em> that causes the time and frequency synchronization to fluctuate as the controller attempts to follow the jitter. The conventional approach to reducing jitter is to low-pass or median filter the error signal. But filtering has the serious disadvantage that reduction of the jitter must be traded off against time delay introduced by the filter. Additional time delay in the feedback loop unavoidably degrades controller performance. The PPS-Client program uses a much better technique that introduces <b>no</b> delay. To reduce the jitter, the time values returned by the system are passed through a hard limiter that clips them before applying them as time corrections.</p>
<p>Indeed, individual time corrections constitute jitter added to a very small time correction. Consequently, each individual correction is mostly jitter and thus is wrong by nearly the amount that it deviates from zero. Because of that, the limiting employed in this system clips the maximum time corrections when the controller has fully stabilized to 1 microsecond.</p>
<p>It might seem that such extreme limiting would remove the desired error signal along with the noise. But that doesn't happen because the true time error is a slowly varying quasi-stationary (DC) level. Limiting only slices off the dynamic (AC) component of the error signal. The DC component remains. (To see what limiting does see Figures 3, 4, and 5 and the relevant discussion.) If the jitter were not limited, the controller would make the sum of the positive and negative jitter zero. That would be undesirable even after filtering because the noise has significant components in time periods that extend to well beyond one minute. Filtering would remove noise only for time intervals within the cut-off region of the filter. Longer period noise would remain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, instead of zeroing the <em>sum</em> of negative and positive jitter and thereby allowing the difference to be introduced as noise, hard limiting causes the controller to make the <em>number</em> of positive and negative excursions to be equal around zero. That happens because the clipped positive and negative amplitudes are identical (1 microsecond). Thus, making the sum zero makes the count equal. As a result, the varying magnitude of the jitter around the control point is ignored and the reported time delay of the PPS rising edge adjusts to its median value, i.e., the delay at which there were as many shorter as longer reported delays over the previous minute.</p>
<p>The only disadvantage of hard limiting is that it reduces the amount of time correction that can be applied each each second. But that limitation is easily circumvented by allowing the hard limit level to track the amount of required time correction. This insures that the hard limit level does not prevent larger time corrections when they are necessary.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="noise-and-latency"></a>
Noise and Latency</h2>
<p>While the average accuracy of the PPS signal is on the order of tens of nanoseconds and the jitter standard deviation in the PPS signal is a fraction of a microsecond, application processors are not particularly suited to maintaining the system time to that order of accuracy. The difficulty is, of course, that typically, an application processor has dozens to hundreds of applications all running at the same time and all competing for processor time. As a result, even for real-time applications, unavoidable delays occur both in responding to an interrupt and also in timestamping it after it has been received. These delays set the limit to processor time accuracy.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is perhaps remarkable that it is possible to achieve microsecond accuracy by characterizing the components of time error and finding methods of reducing or compensating for most of these components. For that reason, this section will identify the contributing components of time error: PPS latency and the latency variation described above as jitter.</p>
<p>Time error, defined as the measurable error between PPS time and the time reported on the local clock, is the sum of a static constant component, the <b>intrinsic PPS interrupt delay</b>, and three identifiable noise components. The intrinsic PPS delay is defined as the time difference, exclusive of noise, between the assertion of the PPS signal as an interrupt and the timestamp record of it provided by the PPS driver. Intrinsic PPS Delay can be <a href="#measuring-zerooffset">measured directly in software</a>. For that reason it can be measured on any processor running Linux, even those without direct GPIO access.</p>
<p>The jitter components of time error are</p>
<p>Type 1: A <b>variable delay</b> component with a time constant up to several minutes introduced primarily by</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>a. processor delay in either responding to the PPS interrupt or in generating the timestamp both resulting from ongoing activity among the many applications running on the processor that compete with PPS-Client for processor time and<br  />
</p>
<p>b. slow drift (and occasionally abrupt micro-shifts) in the system clock oscillator frequency caused by the 1/f nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flicker_noise">flicker noise</a> in the clock oscillator, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Type 2: An approximately <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally-distributed</a> component mixed with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-normal_distribution">half-normal</a> random component composed of</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>a. second-by-second delay changes introduced as in 1a above with a later-time half-normal noise contribution,<br  />
</p>
<p>b. normally distributed jitter from flicker noise in the system clock oscillator and<br  />
</p>
<p>c. normally distributed jitter in the PPS signal source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Type 3: Sporadically occurring spikes of longer duration latency occurring when the scheduler is unable to immediately provide the requested time slot to PPS-Client.</p>
<p>The intrinsic PPS interrupt delay rounded to the nearest microsecond is the <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> correction value that is incorporated into the PPS-Client code. The intrinsic PPS interrupt delay and the Type 1a variable delay component jointly determine the moment to moment zeroOffset. Testing has revealed that the Type 1a noise is <a href="#feedback-controller">usually small</a> in most operating environments.</p>
<p>Type 3, described as <a href="#latency-spikes">latency spikes</a>, is removed by excluding these spikes from the controller feedback loop.</p>
<p>Type 1a and Type 2a noise can both be reduced by changing the application environment in which pps-client is running. However, this is not always practical or desirable. More about this <a href="#test-notes">at the end of this document</a>. Also notice that Type 1a noise and Type 2a noise can only make the PPS delay longer than the intrinsic PPS interrupt delay and not shorter. This characteristic helps to identify these components.</p>
<p>Type 1b noise has components in all time periods. For time periods longer than 1 minute, it is removed by the minute-to-minute corrections made by the integral control feedback of the controller. For time in the range 1 second to 1 minute it is removed by the second-to-second corrections made by the proportional control feedback of the PPS-Client controller.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="the-timeline"></a>
The Timeline</h3>
<p>However, in a time interval shorter than 1 second, <b>Type 2b and 2c noise is an irreducible noise component of time error</b>. In fact these component characterizes a continuous random variable that we will call the <em>timeline</em>. The <em>timeline</em> is the reported time at each instant on the local system clock. It is useful to think of the <em>timeline</em> as the kind of line that would result if one were to draw a straight line between two widely separated points on a white board. Unless the hand that drew the line was particularly skillful, that line would not be very straight. The two points that the <em>timeline</em> connects are the beginning and end of each second on the local clock.</p>
<p>But in between those two points the <em>timeline</em> is ruled by Type 2b noise which varies the time within an interval of a second. The <em>timeline</em> cannot be corrected because it is a random value in each second that is observed only after it has occurred and the value in the next second will also be random and, consequently, cannot be predicted. That is what makes it necessary to characterize the <em>timeline</em>, or the time precision of the local clock, as a statistical quantity. PPS-Client times and synchronizes the <em>timeline</em> only at the beginning of each second and only to the PPS, disregarding the wall clock time.</p>
<p>Although it is randam, the <em>timeline</em> <em>can</em> be characterized by statistical measurements and those measurements then define the accuracy of time synchronization to the PPS. For example, for ten RPi4 processors that were <a href="#test-results">tested</a>, the standard deviation of the <em>timeline</em> was very close to 0.6 microsecond SD and the <em>timeline</em> was found to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally distributed</a>. This can be interpreted in various ways. Such as, with probability 0.68, a time measured on the local clock was within 0.6 microsecond of the PPS, or say, using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">three sigma rule</a>, the local clock error to the PPS was more than +/- 2.4 microseconds only about once in 15,789 timings.</p>
<p>To see how time errors present in practice, typical measured performance of Raspberry Pi processors is shown next.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="raspberry-pi-3"></a>
Raspberry Pi 3</h3>
<p>Raspberry Pi 3 Type 2 noise is shown in Figure 2a for an RPi 3 unit showing typical characteristics from a batch of 10 test units.</p>
<p><a class="anchor" id="timed-event"></a> </p><center><img src="pps-jitter-distrib-RPi3.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Raspberry Pi 3 Jitter Distribution"/>    </center><p>Figure 2a is data that was captured from the test unit over 24 hours to the file <b>/var/local/pps-jitter-distrib</b> by setting <em>jitter-distrib=enable</em> in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b> and is typical data that can be easily generated on any RPi.</p>
<p>Figure 2a shows a delay peak at zero (relative to the <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> value) followed by infrequent sporadic Type 3 latency spikes in the log plot. The nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal</a> distribution of the <em>timeline</em> is also quite evident. This distribution is a combination of all three components of Type 2 noise..</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="raspberry-pi-4"></a>
Raspberry Pi 4</h3>
<p>Raspberry Pi 4 PPS Type 2 noise, captured in the same way as above, is shown in Figure 2b for an RPi 4 unit showing typical characteristics from a batch of ten test units.</p>
<center><img src="pps-jitter-distrib-RPi4.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Raspberry Pi 4 Jitter Distribution"/>    </center><p>Of the three components of Type 2 noise, it is possible to see Type 2a noise separately from the others in a distribution of interrupt delay <em>d<sub>int</sub></em> as in Figure 2c (from RPi4#7 below).</p>
<p>Because this interrupt was generated entirely within Raspberry Pi 4, it is unaffected by the <em>timeline</em> because the measurement is made internal to the processor where time appears to be linear. Any time measurement made totally within the processor is blind to the <em>timeline</em> variations of its own clock oscillator because time is being measured relative to a time reference warped by that same <em>timeline</em>.</p>
<center><img src="interrupt-delay.png" alt="Interrupt Delay" class="inline"/></center><p>This interrupt delay distribution was generated with a utility designed to measure delays. The delay noise is almost entirely Type 2a noise with a standard deviation of 1 microsecond on this processor. The maximum value of this distribution occurs at 4.5 microseconds. As evident in Figure 2c, the Type 2a noise adds to that value. The maximum value of 4.5 microseconds would be subtracted from the recorded clock time to get a true minimum time for the interrupt in this example.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="latency-spikes"></a>
Latency Spikes</h3>
<p>A typical latency spike is evident in the PPS-Client status printout shown below which shows low jitter values except for the latency spike in the middle line of the image.</p>
<center><img src="jitter-spike.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Jitter Spike in Status Printout"/>    </center><p>Since latency spikes are easily identified by the length of delay, they are removed by suspending controller time and frequency updating when delay duration equals or exceeds the controller <code>NOISE_LEVEL_MIN</code> value which is hard coded to 4 microseconds. From the SD values of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally-distributed</a> Type 2 noise determined above, that is jitter starting at 3 to 4 standard deviations from the center of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally-distributed</a> Type 2 noise region.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="the-pps-client-controller"></a>
The PPS-Client Controller</h1>
<p>This section will only be of interest to people who want to understand how the software functions. With previous discussion as background, the sections below provide a cross-referenced summary of the source code. While Doxygen does a credible job of cross-referencing, this summary probably only makes sense while referencing a side-by-side open copy of the source code set up as a project in a cross-referencing editor like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">Eclipse</a>.</p>
<p>The PPS-Client controller can be thought of as consisting of two conceptually different components: A feedback controller and a feedforward compensator.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="feedback-controller"></a>
Feedback Controller</h2>
<p>The PPS-Client controller algorithm processes timestamps of interrupts from a hardware GPIO pin triggered by the rising edge of a PPS signal. These PPS timestamps are recorded by the <code>pps-gpio</code> Linux kernel device driver. However, there is a time delay between the assertion of the PPS signal edge and the time recorded by the timestamp. We can call this the intrinsic PPS delay <em>d<sub>pps</sub></em>. Exclusive of this delay there is also, in principle, an offset introduced by type 2a noise that can prevent the servo from fully settling to a true zero time point. We can call this the settling offset <em>d<sub>noise</sub></em>. This means that in the absence of any correction value, the system time clock offset is</p>
<center><em>t<sub>ofs</sub></em> = <em>d<sub>pps</sub></em> + <em>d<sub>noise</sub></em></center><p>However, even under noisy conditions where there are many delay spikes, <em>d<sub>noise</sub></em> is very low. The reason for that can be explained with a jitter distribution collected from a Raspberry Pi 3 over 24 hours: </p><pre class="fragment">-6 0

</pre><p>Although there are many jitter spikes, PPS-Client ignored all that were beyond 3 microseconds (indicated by the dotted line) and settled on the median of the time samples below 4 microseconds. Now in the absence of any Type 2a noise, the distribution would have been perfectly symmetric around zero and the median of the distribution would have agreed perfectly with its maximum value. We see that is not quite the case. Because the value at -1 is larger than the the value at 1, we can expect that the maximum value is actually earlier than zero. With a software tool like the <a href="#normal-params-utility">normal-params</a> utility that can accurately estimate the position of the maximum we get </p><pre class="fragment">$ normal-params -1 17808 0 47557 1 15421 85825
Relative to the best fit normal distribution:
maximum:  -0.033169
stddev: 0.639956
Relative fit of samples: 0.986724
</pre><p>Which establishes that the median at zero is actually delayed from the true maximum of a normal distribution by about 0.03 microsecond. That is the average value of the settling noise, <em>d<sub>noise</sub></em>. This is typical performance of PPS-Client running on Raspberry Pi processors in unmodified process environments.</p>
<p>Because the settling noise is so low it can be ignored. Thus, a constant <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>, equal to the intrinsic PPS delay, is inserted into the controller feedback loop to remove <em>t<sub>ofs</sub></em>. So that we have,</p>
<center><em><code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code></em> = <em>d<sub>pps</sub></em></center><p>which may alternatively expressed as</p>

But when the <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> correction is made and the servo is in equilibrium then the assertion time of the PPS <em>t<sub>pps</sub></em> is zero on the system clock so that</p>

For this to succeed in adjusting the local time to the PPS, the median of the time at which the system received the rising edge of the PPS interrupt must be <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> where <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> is a positive number. In other words the system received the interrupt <em>earlier</em> by <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> microseconds than the recorded time returned by the timestamp.</p>
<p>While it would be desirable to have a measurement of <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>, that can't be done by the feedback controller. As indicated by the equation, all the controller can do is satisfy the equation of time. In earlier versions of PPS-Client, <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> was measured by the driver. However the Linux driver does not provide that function.</p>
<p>So, in the current incarnation of PPS-Client, <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> is set to constant value (which can be changed in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b>). It will be shown in subsequent sections how the value was determined. Consequently, so called feedfoward compensation is provided by a fixed delay value.</p>
<p>Default values, accurate to 1 microsecond, have been determined for Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi 4 processors and are automatically used. But the value may be different for other application processors. Or it may be desirable to set a more accurate value. In those cases, the <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> would have to be separately measured and the value supplied in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b>. How to do that is described in <a href="#measuring-zerooffset-with-pps-timer">Measuring zeroOffset with pps-timer</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="driver"></a>
Driver</h2>
<p>The PPS-Client daemon was written entirely with user space code. It uses the <b>pps-gpio</b> driver provided in the Linux kernel.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="controller-behavior-on-startup"></a>
Controller Behavior on Startup</h2>
<p>Figure 3 shows the behavior of the controller when PPS-Client is started. The figure shows frequency offset and corresponding time corrections recorded to <b>/etc/local/pps-offsets</b> when saving this file is requested from the <a href="#command-line">command line</a> as <b>pps-offsets</b>.</p>
<p>During the first 120 seconds (not shown in the figure), the controller made time corrections to get the time offset into a reasonable range but made no frequency corrections. Frequency offset correction was enabled at sequence number (second) 120. Over the next 600 seconds the PPS-Client controller adjusted the frequency offset to bring the system clock frequency into sync with the PPS.</p>
<center><img src="pps-offsets-to-720.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Offsets to 720 secs"/>    </center><p>The expanded view of the same data over the first 300 seconds in Figure 4 shows in more detail what is happening. In general, proportional feedback is correcting the time by the (gain-scaled and limited) time error measured each second. The integral feedback is updated each minute with the average of the time corrections over the previous minute. As the integral is formed the result is to move the frequency offset minute by minute towards synchronization. It should be clear that in any minute where the system clock frequency is not perfectly in sync with the PPS, the average length of the second will be either longer or shorter than one second. For example, if the average length of the second differed by 1 microsecond from the true length of the second, that would indicate that the system clock was in error by 1 part per million, in which case an adjustment of the frequency offset by 1 ppm might be expected.</p>
<center><img src="pps-offsets-to-300.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Offsets to 300 secs"/>    </center><p>Now notice that, in the minute between sequence number 120 and 180, there is a clearly visible positive bias in the time correction values. Averaging those time corrections (literally adding them from the figure and dividing by 60), gets a 3.22 microsecond average bias indicating that the system clock is in error by 3.22 parts per million over that minute. However, in the next minute (between 180 and 240), the frequency offset is changed by only about 2 ppm. In other words, frequency offset change is only about 0.632 of the amount needed to do a full frequency correction and, moreover, it is easily verified that same fractional correction is made in every succeeding minute.</p>
<p>The 0.632 fractional adjustment is the damping ratio fixed by the integral gain of the PI controller. That damping value has been chosen to keep the loop stable and, in fact, to set it below the maximum acquire rate provided by a ratio of 1 which corresponds to the full frequency correction.</p>
<p>But why not apply the full frequency correction each second? The reason is that the correction is always made too late. It would have been correct for the minute in which it was measured but by the time it has been measured it can only be an estimate for the next minute. If the estimate is even slightly too large then the estimation error will be integrated along with the estimate and will become progressively larger in each succeeding second until the result is an oscillation of the frequency around its stable value. The design decision is that, considering noise and other system uncertainties, it is better to have the controller acquire more slowly with a lower damping value than to risk oscillation with a higher value.</p>
<p>Once the controller has acquired, it continues to average the time errors that occurred over the past minute and to apply the scaled integral of the average as the frequency correction for the next minute. So theoretically the controller never acquires. Rather it is constantly chasing the value to be acquired with a somewhat low estimate of that value. This seems to argue for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes">Zeno's paradox</a>. In practice, however, the difference between the estimate and the target value soon drops below the noise level so that any practical measurement would indicate that the controller had, indeed, acquired.</p>
<p>The startup transient in Figure 3 is the largest adjustment in frequency the controller ever needs to make and in order to make that adjustment relatively large time corrections are necessary. Once the control loop has acquired, however, then by design the time corrections will exceed 1 microsecond only when the controller must make larger than expected frequency offset corrections. In that case, the controller will simply adjust to larger corrections by raising its hard limit level.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="performance-under-stress"></a>
Performance Under Stress</h2>
<p>To get some idea of what the worst case corrections might be, Figure 5 demonstrates how the PPS-Client control loop responds to stress. In this case a full processor load (100% usage on all four cores) was suddenly applied at sequence number 1900. The loading raised the processor temperature causing a total shift in frequency offset of about 1.7 ppm from onset to a stable value near sequence number 2500. The time corrections increased to 2 microseconds only in the region of steepest ascent. Since the transients caused by extreme load changes occur infrequently, it is likely that a time correction more than 1 microsecond would only occasionally occur in normal operation. Moreover it is unlikely that a precision time measurement would be required simultaneously with the onset of full processor load.</p>
<center><img src="pps-offsets-stress.png" alt="" class="inline" title="PPS offsets to Stress"/>    </center><h2><a class="anchor" id="error-handling"></a>
Error Handling</h2>
<p>All trapped errors are reported to the log file <b>/var/log/pps-client.log</b>. In addition to the usual suspects, PPS-Client also reports PPS dropouts. While most of the reported errors were intended for use in development, some are useful when things go wrong with the PPS signal. So the error file is the best first place to look when that happens.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="testing-and-calibrating"></a>
Testing and Calibrating</h1>
<p>Before performing any test, please make sure that the test environment is clean. At a minimum, if not starting fresh, <b>reboot the RPi's that are being used in the tests</b>. This can eliminate a lot of unexpected problems.</p>
<p>The simplest test is to run PPS-Client and verify with the status printout that the controller locks to the PPS signal to a precision of one microsecond. From a terminal, that can be done at any time while PPS-Client is running with, </p><pre class="fragment">$ pps-client -v
</pre><p>That runs a secondary copy of PPS-Client that just displays a status printout that the PPS-Client daemon continuously generates. When PPS-Client starts up you can expect to see something like the following in the status printout:</p>
<center><img src="StatusPrintoutOnStart.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Status Printout on Startup"/>    </center><p>The <code>jitter</code> value is showing the fractional second offset of the PPS signal according to the system clock. That value will decrease second by second as the controller locks to the PPS signal. Within 10 to 20 minutes the status printout will look like this:</p>
<center><img src="StatusPrintoutAt10Min.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Status Printout after 10 Min"/>    </center><p>The <code>jitter</code> is displaying small numbers. The time of the rising edge of the PPS signal is shown in the second column. The <code>clamp</code> value on the far right indicates that the maximum time correction applied to the system clock is being limited to +/- one microsecond. The system clock is synchronized to the PPS signal to a precision of one microsecond.</p>
<p>It can take as long as 20 minutes for PPS-Client to fully acquire the first time it runs. That happens if the <code>jitter</code> shown in the status printout is on the order of 100,000 microseconds or more. It's quite common for the NTP fractional second to be off by that amount or more. In this case PPS-Client may restart several times as it slowly reduces the <code>jitter</code> offset. That happens because the system function <code><a class="el" href="d5/d60/pps-client_8cpp.html#a4efd2ecedb34b38cd1000d86ba5f6ef9">adjtimex()</a></code> that PPS-Client calls internally prevents time changes of more than about 500 microseconds each second.</p>
<p>Here are the parameters shown in the status printout:</p>
<ul>
<li>First two columns - date and time of the rising edge of the PPS signal.</li>
<li>Third column - the sequence number giving the total PPS interrupts received since PPS-Client was started.</li>
<li><code>jitter</code> - the time deviation in microseconds recorded at the reception of the PPS interrupt.</li>
<li><code>freqOffset</code> - the frequency offset applied to the system clock in parts per million of the system clock frequency in order to synchronize the system clock to the PPS signal.</li>
<li><code>avgCorrection</code> - the time corrections (in microseconds) averaged over the previous minute.</li>
<li><code>clamp</code> - the hard limit (in microseconds) applied to the raw time error to convert it to a time correction.</li>
</ul>
<p>If NIST is being used to provide whole-second time of day then about every 17 minutes, an NIST time query will be made and the results of that will be shown, but will have no effect unless a time update is required. The infrequency of time checks is a requirement of using the NIST service. However, if GPS is used to provide whole seconds, time checks are made every 10 seconds but no message is displayed.</p>

<p>The PPS-Client daemon writes the timestamp and sequence number of the PPS rising edge to an in-memory file that changes every second. You can verify that the time is being controlled and that the controller is currently active by entering this a few times: </p><pre class="fragment">$ cat /run/shm/pps-assert
</pre><p>Executing that twice in succession would generate something like this: </p><pre class="fragment">pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /run/shm/pps-assert
1460044256.000001#173028
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ cat /run/shm/pps-assert
1460044259.000000#173031
</pre><p>The timestamp is displayed in seconds to the nearest microsecond. This is probably the most foolproof way of determining that PPS-Client is currently running. If you get the same numbers for the whole second value twice in succession or none at all you know it's not.</p>
<p>Another way to tell that PPS-Client is running is to get the process id with, </p><pre class="fragment">$ pidof pps-client
</pre><p>which will only return a PID if PPS-Client is an active process.</p>

Performance Evaluation</h2>
<p>Data can be collected while PPS-Client is running either by setting specific data files to be saved in the PPS-Client configuration file or by requesting others from the command line of a terminal that is communicating with the RPi.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="configuration-file"></a>
Configuration File</h3>
<p>Data that can be collected using the configuration file is enabled with settings in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b>. These instruct the PPS-Client daemon to generate data files, some of which provided the data used to generate the spreadsheet graphs shown on this page and in the project README file. Generating a particular file requires setting a flag. All of these files are disabled by default. But they can be enabled or disabled at any time, including while the PPS-Client daemon is running, by editing and saving the config file. Here are the flags you can use to enable them:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>error-distrib=enable</b> generates <b>/var/local/pps-error-distrib-forming</b> which contains the currently forming distribution of time corrections to the system clock. When 24 hours of corrections have been accumulated, these are transferred to <b>/var/local/pps-error-distrib</b> which contains the cumulative distribution of time corrections applied to the system clock over 24 hours.</li>
<li><b>jitter-distrib=enable</b> generates <b>/var/local/pps-jitter-distrib-forming</b> which contains the currently forming distribution of jitter values. When this distribution is sufficiently free of jitter that exceeds 3 microseconds then this is also a distribution of the <em>timeline</em>. When 24 hours of corrections have been accumulated, these are transferred to <b>/var/local/pps-jitter-distrib</b> which contains the cumulative distribution of all time (jitter) values recorded at reception of the PPS interrupt over 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that while the turnover interval for some of the files above is given as 24 hours, the interval will usually be slightly longer than 24 hours because PPS-Client runs on an internal count, <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a1b7d7e301e8d89460f39703eefa1691b" title="Advancing count of active (not skipped) controller cycles once G.isControlling is &quot;true&quot;.">G.activeCount</a></code>, that does not count lost PPS interrupts or skipped jitter spikes.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="command-line"></a>
Command Line</h3>
<p>Some of the data that can be saved by a running PPS-Client daemon is of the on-demand type. This is enabled by executing PPS-Client with the <code>-s</code> flag while the daemon is running. Please note that this data is dumped to a file only when you specifically request it as below. It is continuously updated in the daemon but the file is not automatically updated like the files requested in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b>. For example, </p><pre class="fragment">$ pps-client -s frequency-vars
</pre><p>will return something like this </p><pre class="fragment">pps-client v2.0.0 is running.
Writing to default file: /var/local/pps-frequency-vars
</pre><p>The file will be copied from data in PPS-Client as the data was when the command above was issued. The same is true for the other files. If the data is of the 24 hour type the daemon must have run at least that long for you to get a complete file.</p>
<p>You can write to a different filename or location by using the <code>-f</code> flag followed by the desired path and filename: </p><pre class="fragment">$ pps-client -s frequency-vars -f data/freq-vars-01.txt
</pre><p>These files will be incomplete if PPS-Client has not been running for some corresponding minimum time. The specified directories must already exist.</p>
<p>You may also include the <code>-v</code> flag if you want the status display to start as soon as the requested file is written to disk.</p>
<p>As an aid to remembering what can be requested, omitting the type of data will print a list of what's available. Currently that would result in something like, </p><pre class="fragment">PPS-Client v2.0.0 is running.
Error: Missing argument for -s.
Accepts any of these:
rawError
frequency-vars
pps-offsets
</pre><p>described as,</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rawError</code> writes an exponentially decaying distribution of unprocessed PPS jitter values as they enter the controller. These are relative to the current value of <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>. Jitter values added to the distribution has a half-life of one hour. So the distribution is almost completely refreshed every four to five hours.</li>
<li><code>frequency-vars</code> writes the last 24 hours of <b>clock frequency offset</b> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"><b>Allan deviation</b></a> of one-minute samples in each five-minute interval indexed by the timestamp at each interval.</li>
<li><code>pps-offsets</code> writes the previous 10 minutes of recorded time offsets and applied frequency offsets indexed by the sequence number (<code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a6023bf80d5055646e3b81f45f00df497" title="Advancing count of the number of PPS interrupt timings that have been received.">G.seq_num</a></code>) each second.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>clock frequency offset</b> is the offset in parts per million of the clock oscillator frequency that was applied to the clock oscillator to keep the clock synchronized to the PPS signal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance"><b>Allan deviation</b></a> is also plotted in parts per million and can be interpreted to be the average (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square">RMS</a>) frequency drift (in parts per million per minute) between adjacent frequency samples one minute apart measured at each five minute interval. Parts per million of oscillator frequency drift corresponds directly to microseconds of error; so the Allan deviation can also be interpreted as average (RMS) microseconds of minute to minute clock drift between frequency updates.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="determining-precision"></a>
Determining Precision</h2>
<p>Before we can determine time accuracy we first need to determine precision. Precision is determined by the <a href="#the-timeline"><em>timeline</em></a>. With sufficient precision, we can measure <em>time accuracy</em> which is defined as the absolute time error at any point in time relative to the PPS time clock provided by GPS satellites.</p>
<center><img src="time.png" alt="" class="inline" title="Interpretation of accuracy and precision"/>    </center><p>Figure 7 is a distribution of time corrections made by the PPS-Client controller to the system clock. This data was collected over a 24 hour period by removing the comment tag from <b>#error-distrib=enable</b> in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b>. After 24 hours the filename would be <b>/var/local/pps-error-distrib</b>.</p>
<center><img src="offset-distrib.png" alt="" class="inline" title="24 Hour Offset Distribution"/>    </center><p>This data was captured from a Raspberry Pi 4 running Raspberry Pi OS on a standard 5.4.51-v7l+ Linux kernel. Unlike many of the other plots of a similar appearance scattered throughout this document, this is a plot of a discrete variable that can only take on integer values corresponding to whole second corrections made by the proportional element of the PPS-Client controller.</p>
<p>The prominent central peak reports the number of times in 24 hours that <em>timeline</em> wandering remained within a boundary of +/- 1 microsecond. The peak to the left reports the number of times a microsecond had to be subtracted from the <em>timeline</em> to keep it within those bounds and added, similarly, for the peak on the right. The important point is that the time corrections required to keep the <em>timeline</em> synchronized to the rising edge of the PPS signal never exceeded 1 microsecond in this 24 hour period. This was true for all Raspberry Pi units tested.</p>
<p>The second important point is that the <em>timeline</em> determines time measurement <em>precision</em>. As the PPS-Client controller maintained an average straight time line at the beginning of each second, the <em>timeline</em>, which is modified by the variation in the clock oscillator frequency (and PPS variation), shifted the local time above and below a straight line by the value of the the <em>timeline</em> at every other point in the second. However at the end of each second if the the <em>timeline</em> was greater than 1 microsecond then the negative 1 microsecond correction made by the PPS-Client controller reduced the value of the the <em>timeline</em> by 1 microsecond and conversely. By this means the <em>timeline</em> was "gently encouraged" to remain within the one microsecond boundaries most of the time. <br  />
</p>
<p>As described <a href="#the-timeline">above</a>, the <em>timeline</em> is a random variable best described as normally distributed with a <a href="#test-results">standard deviation</a> of 0.6 microsecond for RPi4 and 0.9 microsecond for RPi3. Because the <em>timeline</em> is forced to remain near zero relative to the PPS each time it occurs, that statistical description is also the <em>precision</em>.</p>
<p>However the <em>timeline</em> has no knowledge of the whole second time of day. To the extent <em>that</em> is properly determined then the <em>precision</em> is also the <em>accuracy</em> of the time.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="determining-accuracy"></a>
Determining Accuracy</h2>
<p>This version of PPS-Client uses the PPS driver (<b>pps-gpio.ko</b>) provided in Linux. That driver does not provide a mechanism for measuring the time delay between the asserted edge of the PPS signal and the time recorded for it in the kernel. In most of the applications of PPS-Client, the uncertainty of that value probably won't matter. But there <em>are</em> some applications that use processor GPIO pins to measure the times of external events. In such applications it can be useful to determine the time difference between the asserted PPS edge and its reported timestamp as accurately as possible. Fortunately, that value, the PPS delay, appears to be nearly constant for a particular choice of processor and operating system and can be measured. So once we determine the PPS delay we can use that delay value as a constant correction for <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>. Most users will not be interested in performing these tests. This information is provided to show how accuracy was determined and, for those who are interested, how to replicate the measurements on the Raspberry Pi or, with appropriate modifications, other processors. The next section describes the method used to determine <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="measuring-zerooffset"></a>
Measuring ZeroOffset</h3>
<p>The goal in the following sections is to measure <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> to the nearest microsecond. Consequently, components of and corrections to the value of <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> are timed to tenths of a microsecond. The value of <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> that we are seeking is exclusive of any jitter that the system will add to the value. For that reason, long averages of parameters are made specifically to determine mean values that average out latency and jitter. It might seem that this is a lot of trouble to go to just establish a microsecond value for <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>. However the measurements have established that the Raspberry Pi 4 is a very good time keeper, capable of measuring the time of an external event on a gpio pin to microsecond accuracy.</p>
<p>On the Raspberry Pi and other Linux ARM processors as well, the <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> delay can be measured entirely in software. That means that, at least in principle, <b><code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> can be measured and calibrated on many Linux systems</b>.</p>
<p>For purposes of this discussion, the PPS interrupt is defined as the time of the rising edge of the PPS signal. The software application that measures <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> is <a href="#the-pps-timer-utility"><b>pps-timer</b></a>. The app uses a kernel time function, <em>ktime_get_real_fast_ns()</em> to probe the earliest time that the PPS interrupt triggers its interrupt service routine. The ISR suspends other processes running on the same core and, in particular, it suspends <b>pps-timer</b>. The <em>ktime_get_real_fast_ns()</em> execution time is on the order of 0.2 microseconds or less (on the RPi's) if it executes before the PPS interrupt service routine, but is delayed and is much longer if it begins to execute after the PPS ISR begins executing. The time reported by <em>ktime_get_real_fast_ns()</em> before it was delayed is recorded and is interpreted to be the time that the PPS interrupt occurred to within about a tenth of a microsecond.</p>
<p>When the time of the PPS interrupt is timed with pps-timer on a processor running with <b>zeroOffset=0</b> in <b>/etc/pps-client.conf</b>, the PPS interrupt time will be a time somewhere in the range of about -3 to -12 microseconds.</p>
<p>The plot in Figure 8 shows how the PPS interrupt time looks on a typical Raspberry Pi 4. The graph appears to be a normal distribution. But that is incorrect. It is actually a super-position of a half normal distribution and a normal distribution. The distribution was collected by the pps-timer utility while monitoring the PPS interrupt time. Neither pps-timer nor pps-client can actually cause a distribution tail that moves in the direction of decreasing clock time. The negative-going tail is caused by pps-timer being bumped by jitter toward later times relative to pps-client, causing time values to appear earlier in time. Times later than the maximum of the distribution are introduced by jitter experienced by pps-client but not by pps-timer.</p>
<p>The maximum of the forward normal distribution is -3.58 microseconds and the standard distribution is 0.42 microsecond. Those values were determined by the <a href="#normal-params-utility">normal-params utility</a>.</p>
<center><img src="pps-time.png" alt="" class="inline" title="PPS Time RPi 4"/>    </center><p>Figure 9 is typical of a Raspberry Pi 3. The maximum of the forward normal distribution in this case is -7.32 and the standard deviation is 0.62.</p>
<center><img src="pps-time-rpi3.png" alt="" class="inline" title="PPS Time RPi 3"/>    </center><p>These plots are of 86,400 accumulated PPS interrupt times collected over a period of 24 hours. They are representative of the data that is used to determine <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>.</p>
<p>The local clock is not corrected which means that it is literally synchronized to the timestamp of the PPS signal which is taken to be time zero. Clearly, from Figure 8, the actual time of occurrence of the PPS signal for this Raspberry Pi 4 is -3.58 microseconds earlier. To correct the local clock so that the time of the PPS signal is at zero, we need to add the positive value corresponding to the negative offset seen in Figure 8.</p>

Test Software</h2>
<p>With one exception, <a href="#normal-params-utility">the normal-params utility</a>, the test software requires kernel drivers that can only be compiled by the kernel build system. Since most users will not be interested in performing the measurements made by the test software themselves, applications are provided only in source form. To get the kernel build system, a Linux kernel must be downloaded, compiled and installed. On a Raspberry Pi 4, this can be done in about an hour.</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="compiling-the-kernel"></a>
Compiling the Kernel</h3>
<p>The build steps below are intended for a kernel that has been compiled with CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled. This includes current versions of Raspbian and Raspberry Pi OS. To verify that a specific version has CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled run, </p><pre class="fragment">~ $ sudo modprobe configs
~ $ zgrep MODVERSIONS /proc/config.gz
</pre><p>In order to use the build steps the result must be, </p><pre class="fragment">~ $ CONFIG_MODVERSIONS=y
</pre><p>Before compiling the kernel insure that your system is up to date. </p><pre class="fragment">~ $ sudo apt-get update
~ $ sudo apt-get upgrade
~ $ sudo reboot
</pre><p>In your home folder on your Raspberry Pi, you might want to first set up a build folder: </p><pre class="fragment">~ $ mkdir rpi
~ $ cd rpi
</pre><p>Then get missing dependencies required for compiling: </p><pre class="fragment">~/rpi $ sudo apt-get install bc git bison flex libssl-dev make build-essential
</pre><p>For retrieving the Linux source get the rpi-source script: </p><pre class="fragment">~/rpi $ sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notro/rpi-source/master/rpi-source -O /usr/bin/rpi-source &amp;&amp; sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/rpi-source &amp;&amp; /usr/bin/rpi-source -q --tag-update
</pre><p>Run the script as shown next. This will download the Linux source that matches the installed version of Linux on your RPi: </p><pre class="fragment">~/rpi $ rpi-source -d ./ --nomake --delete
</pre><p>You may get a message that "ncurses-devel is NOT installed." You won't need it. The setup doesn't use menuconfig.</p>
<p>On the RPi, </p><pre class="fragment">~/rpi $ cd linux

<h3><a class="anchor" id="the-pps-timer-utility"></a>
The pps-timer Utility</h3>
<p>Assuming that you have the PPS-Client directory in the <code>~/rpi</code> directory, then to install pps-timer, </p><pre class="fragment">~ $ cd ~/rpi/PPS-Client/utils/pps-timer
~/rpi/PPS-Client/utils/pps-timer $ make
~/rpi/PPS-Client/utils/pps-timer $ sudo make install
</pre><p>If you need to recompile pps-timer first do, </p><pre class="fragment">~/rpi/PPS-Client/utils/pps-timer $ sudo make clean
</pre><p>This utility will directly measure <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>. The measurement errors introduced by pps-timer are much less than a microsecond. The second-to-second accuracy of pps-timer is +/- 0.1 microsecond for the RPi4 and +/- 0.2 microsecond for the RPi3.</p>
<p>Systematic errors were determined by using pps-timer to time an interrupt generated on a GPIO pin at a precisely known time. This was done for ten RPi3 and ten RPi4 processors. Two uncorrected errors were found. The first error is a read delay between the interrupt rising edge time on the GPIO pin and the time recorded by pps-timer. The second error is an increase in the interrupt timestamp reported by the system when pps-timer is timing the interrupt.</p>
<p>For RPi3 the read delay averages 0.12 microsecond and the interrupt time increase averages 0.2 microsecond. Because these errors are in opposite directions, the net error is 0.08 microsecond.</p>
<p>For RPi4 the read delay averages 0.04 microsecond and the interrupt timer increase averages 0.10 microsecond for a net error of 0.06 microsecond.</p>
<p>Because these errors are very small, they are ignored. A LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet, PPS-Timer-Errors.ods, containing the data collected for the twenty Raspberry Pi processors is included in the pps-timer folder.</p>
<p>Measurements collected by pps-timer are written to <b>/var/local/pps-time-distrib-forming</b> and <b>/var/local/prop-delay-distrib-forming</b>. After 24 hours these results are transferred to <b>/var/local/pps-time-distrib</b> and <b>/var/local/prop-delay-distrib</b>.</p>
<p>The pps-timer utility requires no arguments (unless the bin resolution is changed from the default of 0.5 microseconds) and automatically loads its kernel driver. To run it, </p><pre class="fragment">$ sudo pps-timer
</pre><p>and stop it with ctrl-c. Or run it detached with, </p><pre class="fragment">$ sudo pps-timer &amp;

</pre><h3><a class="anchor" id="normal-params-utility"></a>
The normal-params Utility</h3>
<p>The normal-params utility, which requires no driver, is automatically installed when pps-client is installed.</p>
<p>The distributions obtained in testing PPS-Client are usually narrow which makes it difficult to estimate peaks and standard deviations. Moreover there is ample evidence that the random component of the PPS-Client distributions is well-modeled by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> but is also binned over a small number of bins. The <code>normal-params</code> program makes it possible to directly compute normal distribution parameters from binned values of a sample distribution.</p>
<p>The program fits a one-million-sample Monte Carlo simulation to three binned sample values from the distribution. If the sample distribution departs from normal, there will be a conformance error listed as relative fit which is a measure of the reliability of the calculated values of both ideal mean and ideal SD. Roughly speaking, relative fit is the probability that the samples are actually drawn from a normal distribution.</p>
<p>Bins are centered on the sample x-coordinate values entered to the program. For example the bin at 800000 in the example below extends from 799999.5 to 800000.5.</p>
<p>The program can be used to determine mean and SD for any of the sample distributions collected in testing PPS-Client including positive-only distributions which fit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-normal_distribution">half-normal distribution</a> in the direction of increasing delay or forward time.</p>
<p>If the distribution is entirely half-normal then enter only completely filled bins in the direction away from the maximum and <b>use double the number of actual samples</b> to make normal-params treat the bins as those from the right side of a normal distribution. For example, the interrupt delay distribution in <a href="#raspberry-pi-4">Figure 2c</a> was evaluated for mean and standard deviation by providing the sample numbers for the sample bins from 5 forward like this (only 43,200 actual samples were collected), </p><pre class="fragment">$ normal-params 5 29247 6 11742 7 1846 86400
Relative to the best fit normal distribution:
maximum:  4.493750
stddev: 1.007466
Relative fit of samples: 0.999728
</pre><p>Bear in mind that it's only a half-normal distribution if nearly all of the samples are in one direction or the other from the maximum.</p>
<p>For a distribution expected to be nearly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normally distributed</a> the points would usually be selected around the center of the distribution like this: </p><pre class="fragment">$ normal-params 799999 10212 800000 17382 800001 10275 43200
Relative to the best fit normal distribution:
maximum:  800000.002945
stddev: 0.947150
Relative fit of samples: 0.995888
</pre><p>There is also a third possibility and this is the most common case: A half-normal distribution mixed with a normal distribution. This applies to distributions collected by the pps-timer utility where the half of the distribution in the direction of increasing time is the result of Type 2b and 2c noise in PPS-Client and the half of the distribution in the direction of decreasing time is the result of Type 2a noise in the pps-timer utility. In this case no doubling of the count for either distributions is necessary. For example, for this pps-timer distribution the two different distributions are visually quite evident, </p><pre class="fragment">-13 4
-12 0
-11 2
-10 25
 -9 484
 -8 6695
 -7 24608
 -6 33413
 -5 18978
 -4 2183
 -3 1
 -2 0
 -1 0
</pre><p>In the direction of later time (PPS-Client Type 2b and 2c noise), </p><pre class="fragment">$ normal-params -5 18978 -4 2183 -3 1
Relative to the best fit normal distribution:
mean:  -6.048083
stddev: 0.795988
Relative fit of samples: 0.999613
</pre><p>In the direction of earlier time (pps-timer Type 2a noise), </p><pre class="fragment">$ normal-params -10 25 -9 484 -8 6695
Relative to the best fit normal distribution:
mean:  -6.291076
stddev: 0.873670
Relative fit of samples: 0.999902
</pre><p>Because there is an abundance of samples, the normal-params utility accurately resolves maximum and SD of the separate half-normal distributions. But, of course, this assumes that each distribution had 43,200 samples in its half of the distribution which might not be the case. Nevertheless, the approximation is good if the difference in the two distributions is not extreme because the normal-params utility is relatively insensitive to the number of samples in the distribution. For example, changing the number of samples in the distribution by +/- 2000 only changes the position of the maximum by +/- 0.01 microsecond in both of the distributions above.</p>
<p>For very narrow distributions only one or two sample bins might be filled. If there are two bins, the normal-params utility can handle that too. In this case it uses the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_mass">center of mass</a> calculation for a system of (two) particles.

Measuring zeroOffset with pps-timer</h2>
<p>Open a terminal to the processor you are testing. Make sure that you have compiled the application as described <a href="#the-pps-timer-utility">above</a>. Then verify that PPS Client is running, </p><pre class="fragment">$ pps-client -v
</pre><p>If you get the typical pps-client output, ctrl-c, then the first thing you want to do is to set the current <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> value to zero, </p><pre class="fragment">$ sudo nano /etc/pps-client.conf
</pre><p>Scroll down to </p><pre class="fragment">#zeroOffset=0
</pre><p>and uncomment it, </p><pre class="fragment">zeroOffset=0
</pre><p>Then ctrl-s ctrl-x to save and exit nano. The new value of <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code> will be immediately updated by the pps-client daemon. The pps-timer utility requires no parameters. It will load its driver and immediately start recording samples of the PPS interrupt triggering its ISR.</p>
<p>For for a Raspberry Pi 4, to load and start the app, just do, </p><pre class="fragment">$ sudo pps-timer &amp;
</pre><p>At this point you should see something like,</p>

Test Results</h2>
<p>Ten Raspberry Pi 3 and ten Raspberry Pi 4 processors were evaluated with pps-timer. The test file of interest is <b>/var/local/pps-time-distrib</b>. After 24 hours, the pps-time-distrib file has accumulated a distribution of 86,400 samples of PPS time. <b>All of these distributions are mixed half-normal and normal</b> and were evaluated as such. In all cases there is a half-normal distribution in the direction of earlier time caused by Type 2a noise that is jitter in pps-timer. The distribution corresponding to PPS-Client is in the direction of later time.</p>
<p>The maximum value of the normal distribution provides the jitter-free estimate of the PPS time. The maximum value for each processor was determined with the normal-params utility. For example, for Raspberry Pi 4 unit #1 the <b>/var/local/pps-time-distrib</b> file provided the following distribution, </p><pre class="fragment"> -7.5 0
 -7.0 11
 -6.5 67
 -6.0 1180
 -5.5 11119
 -5.0 30041
 -4.5 31026
 -4.0 12126
 -3.5 824
 -3.0 2
 -2.5 0
</pre><p>This is a mixed half-normal and normal distribution in the direction of later time that was plotted as the graph in Figure 8. Three bin values from the later time normal distribution were provided to the <a href="#normal-params-utility">normal-params</a> utility resulting in, </p><pre class="fragment">$ normal-params -3.5 37879 -3.0 16671 -2.5 214
Relative to the best fit normal distribution:
mean:  -3.586802
stddev: 0.417912
Relative fit of samples: 0.988177
</pre><p>The maximum value is the best estimate of the PPS rising edge time and that value was rounded and sign inverted to provide <code><a class="el" href="dc/d1d/struct_g.html#a74af8a09e316b090ad2412c79fd367ee">G.zeroOffset</a></code>. That is the second line in the table of Raspberry Pi 4 times below. Data for the Raspberry Pi 3 was processed identically.</p>

Test Notes</h2>
<p>The testing was done by segregating PPS-Client and the pps-timer utility from the other processes running on the RPi processors. These programs were confined to a single core of the processor with the <em>system taskset utility</em> and as much as possible the remaining processes running on the processor were pushed onto the three remaining cores. This was not successful for all processes because some are not movable. Nevertheless, this worked well for the Raspberry Pi processors. For example, this is the <a href="#configuration-file">PPS jitter</a> distribution recorded for RPi4#2 </p><pre class="fragment">-8 0

</pre><p>All 86,400 time values are displayed in this section of the distribution. You might want to compare this with the distribution provided in the <a href="#feedback-controller">Feedback Controller</a> section of this document which is typical when no segregation is done. Segregation is not always practical because it effectively reduces the number of working cores by one. But if the sole purpose of the processor is its time measuring capability this is clearly quite effective for RPi processors. </p>
